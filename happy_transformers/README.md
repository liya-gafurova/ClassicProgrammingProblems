In Transformers v4.0.0, the default path to cache downloaded models changed from '~/.cache/torch/transformers' to '~/.cache/huggingface/transformers'. Since you don't seem to have overridden and '~/.cache/torch/transformers' is a directory that exists, we're moving it to '~/.cache/huggingface/transformers' to avoid redownloading models you have already in the cache. You should only see this message once.
